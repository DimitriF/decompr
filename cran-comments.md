Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Leontief (3:60, 6:59)
  Zhu (3:52, 5:27, 5:47, 8:53)
  decompositions (4:38)

* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
  No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped

Regarding the spelling, the first two are names, the last one is the plural of decomposition.

All three are already present in the version currently on CRAN.

Upon the suggestion of Prof. Ripley I have changed the spelling of the following items in the DESCRIPTION file

(title)
Global Value Chain Decomposition -> Global-Value-Chain Decomposition

(description)
Global Value Chain -> global-value-chain
value added -> value-added
