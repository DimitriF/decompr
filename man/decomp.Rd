\title{Interface function for decompositions}
\usage{
decomp(x, y, method = "wwz")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the intermediate demand table,
where the first row and the first column list the country names,
the second row and second column list the industry names for each country.
The matrix is presumed to be of dimensions G*N, where G represents the country and N the industry.
No extra columns should be included.
The last row (i.e. row G*N+1) should contain final demand.}

\item{y}{the final demand table it has dimensions G*M,
where the first row and the first column list the country names,
the second row lists the industry names for each country,
(where M is the number of objects final demand is decomposed into,
e.g. household consumption, here this is into five decompositions).}

\item{method}{user specifies the decomposition method}
}
\value{
The output when using the WWZ algorithm is a matrix with dimensions GNG*19. Whereby 19 is the 16 objects the WWZ algorithm decomposes exports into, plus three checksums. GNG represents source country, using industry and using country.
}

This function runs the decomposition
